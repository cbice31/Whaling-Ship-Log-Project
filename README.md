# Whaling-Ship-Log-Project
This project focuses on the analysis of historical whaling ship logbook data. The primary goal is to compare and cross-check reported sightings between ships at sea to assess the accuracy and consistency of recorded weather data. This includes wind force and wind direction comparisons, as well as identifying ships mentioned in sightings that lack corresponding data entries.

# Project Overview
Using a dataset of whaling ship logbooks, this analysis contains three main components:

# Wind Force Comparison

Filters the dataset to isolate ships that reported sighting one another.

Merges relevant data entries.

Compares and visualizes differences in reported wind force values.

Plots data on a map to visualize the wind force difference between ships

# Wind Direction Comparison

Follows the same methodology as the wind force analysis.

Focuses on comparing reported wind directions between ships at the same location and time.

Compares wind directions using wind roses

Plots data on map using arrows to visualize the wind direction

# Missing Ship Data Identification

Identifies ships that are reported as being sighted but do not have corresponding entries within the dataset.

Useful for identifying logbooks that need to be digitized.
